This guide will walk you through the implementation of the classic Minesweeper game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Minesweeper is a logic-based game where the player must clear a grid of hidden mines without triggering any of them. The game provides clues about the number of mines in adjacent cells, which helps the player deduce the locations of the mines. This implementation covers the setup of the game board, mine placement, revealing cells, marking cells, and checking for win conditions.

By the end of this guide, you will have a functional Minesweeper game that runs in a web browser. The implementation is divided into three parts: HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the game logic. Each part will be explained in detail, along with inline comments to help you understand the code.
